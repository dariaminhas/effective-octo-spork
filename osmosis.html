<h1>Osmosis</h1>

  <h2>What is osmosis?</h2>
  <p>Diffusion sees molecules in an area of high concentration move to areas with a lower concentration, while osmosis refers to the process by which water, or other solvents, moves through a semipermeable membrane, leaving other bits of matter in its wake. Simply put, osmosis is the diffusion of water.</p>
  <h3>Osmotic Pressure</h3>
  <p>Osmotic pressure is the amount of pressure that must be applied to the solution side to stop fluid movement when a semipermeable membrane separates a solution from pure water. Osmotic pressure is of vital importance in biology as the cell's membrane is selective toward many of the solutes found in living organisms. When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water actually flows out of the cell into the surrounding solution thereby causing the cells to shrink and lose its turgidity.</p>
  <h3>Osmotic Gradient</h3>
  <p>The osmotic gradient is just like the concentration or electrochemical gradient; the difference in concentration between two solutions on either side of a semipermeable membrane, and is used to tell the difference in percentages of the concentration of a specific particle dissolved in a solution. If there would be for example human blood on one side and pure water on the other one, the osmotic pressure would be around seven atmospheres.</p>
  <h3>Reverse Osmosis</h3>
  <p>Reverse osmosis (RO) is a separation process that uses pressure to force a solution through a membrane that retains the solute on one side and allows the pure solvent to pass to the other side. RO removes lead from water and frees people from many diseases such as high blood pressure, nerve damage and low fertility. Drinking reverse osmosis water can also eliminate risks of brain damage and anemic conditions, especially in children. Parasites are another threat to clean and safer water.</p>
  <h3>Forward Osmosis</h3>
  <p>Forward osmosis is a water separation process in which a semipermeable membrane is used to separate water from dissolved solutes. FO uses natural energy in the form of osmotic pressure to transport water through the membrane while retaining the dissolved solutes on the other side.</p>
